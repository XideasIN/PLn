                      ↓
    Client Role → Client Area Dashboard
    Admin Role  → Admin Panel Dashboard
```

### **Security Features:**

### **Navigation Between Areas:**
- **Public** → Anyone can access and apply
- **Client** → Must login, can only see their own data
- **Admin** → Must login with admin role, can see all data
- **Cross-links** → Admin can view client profiles, clients can logout to public

## 📱 **Responsive Design**

All three areas are **fully responsive** and work seamlessly on:
- Desktop computers
- Tablets
- Mobile phones
- Different screen orientations

## 🎯 **User Journey Flow**
