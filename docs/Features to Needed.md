System Features

1.The system will assign each client with a **6 digit reference number**
upon submitting an application, starting point is set by the Admin. This
references the client at all times and Admin will have the ability to
place it on Email, Documents, etc. by simply adding the code, for
example - {ref#}. The system via AI will create/recreate documents
created by Admin and include all necessary coding to allow for reference
#, name etc. to be personalized to each outgoing email.

2.When the Admin or Agent inputs a Memo on a client, the system will
automatically mark the Client File in a different color or some marker
to show both Admin/Agent that this client has been Memoed that day,
[which will show up when viewing the Client List]{.underline}. The
client file is still accessible, however it will indicate to ALL that
someone has added a memo to the client\'s profile for that day. This
will not occur when systems auto emails are sent out and added to the
Client's memo. When viewing Clients in list form, this will show in a
colored highlight, once the day has passed it will show with numbers
representing the number of days since interaction with the Client, with
1 meaning 1 day ago.

3.Admin should be able to restrict access to the system based on IP
address. This option would allow Admin to allow access to the system
based on certain IP addresses ONLY. Multiple IPs can be listed in the
system. If Admin access from a non-listed IP address system will request
a secondary password in order to gain access. This limited IP access
restriction is for Admin/Agent/Customer services. IP limited access will
be based on Country or actual IP.

4.The system should allow Clients to Upload files within their client
area when they log into the system. Here Client will be able to Post a
Memo Request to their file which the Admin/Agent will see. When the
Client Post Request it will be listed in the System Inbox. Agent/Admin
can then go into the Inbox and click on the Request *(client internal
EMail)* and this will bring them to the Client Profile page. Here they
can now respond to the Client. Once Admin/Agents respond to the
response, a memo is posted to the client's profile and an email is sent
to the Client to check their inbox for Updates. If Admin/Agent sends out
a Pre-Formatted System Email that email will go out along with a request
for the client to check their Account. This response is different from a
general memo input, which is for internal memo use while when Client
post to their Internal Mail section is email to the client and posted to
system. When Agent responds, it is email to the client and posted to the
system.

> **Internal Mail:** Admin/Agent emails sent to Clients are emailed to
> Client\'s email address and posted in their Inbox. The agent should be
> able to send a message to Admin, this will be internal communication.

5.One Application per person, currently, the system does not allow a
Client to place more thanone application, make sure this is working and
that it blocks an application based on theEmail address and SIN #, if
either of these numbers is within the system person should not beable to
submit another application. No duplicate Email, SIN or Cell Number,
**ACTIVE**

6.If the client Cancels system auto sends a cancel email, and disables
their account *(when* *logged in they will see an image saying "account
canceled", if they sent a payment they will*

> *also see Refund In Process (animated), all other options will be
> disabled except for sending*
>
> *mail to Agent/Admin)*
>
> If a Client's file is Canceled the System will send out the following
> emails:
>
> \- immediately on Cancellation an Email goes out stating their file
> has been canceled.
>
> \- 2 days after another email goes out asking the client to complete
> an AI-generated survey.

7.USA and Canadian clients will be placed in separate folders. USA
Clients will see USA banking

Form and Canadians will see CDN form. The 2 Forms which will be for
either USA clients or

CDN clients will be the Bank Form and Payment Form. Also, the
Application will have a new

> field called Country, inside the country there will be the United
> States and Canada selection.
>
> If CDN is selected then the form shows the Provinces and Postal code

8.The system will auto display the currency of the client\'s country and
convert it to US dollar amount. All figures inputted by Admin is in US
Dollars.

9.If the Client Application is edited by the Admin system will save
previous settings in the memo section *(all memos are date stamped).*

10\. After a Preformatted Email is sent by Admin/Agent it will be posted
as being sent in the memo section. This Memo will show the Email
Template Name that has been sent only and date.

11\. Add Fee Sent Form to be completed after the Client pays fees, this
form will be edited based on the country the client resides.

> USA Form: send methods in the drop-down menu: *Wire Transfer/ Crypto
> /amount / date sent* CDN Form: send methods in the drop-down menu:
> *E-Transfer, Crypto/amount / date sent* AUS Form: send methods in the
> drop-down menu: *Wire Transfer/ Crypto /amount / date sent* UK Form:
> send methods in the drop-down menu: *Wire Transfer/ Crypto /amount /
> date sent* This form will be accessible from the Client Area.

12\. Redesign the Admin area, will have a minimalist layout and design.\
Design 3 or 4 custom email templates which will be used for outgoing
emails

13\. On the Application there is a Field called 'Loan Type', this field
has about 5 different types of loans that clients can apply for. Within
the Admin section Admin will set the interest rate for each type of
loan, Clients Loan Terms will be calculated based on the Rates set here.

14\. When the System receives a New Application it will alert all
Agents, so that the Client can be contacted at that time. There can be a
CALL BOX which will be a circle with a number inside of it. The number
will represent how many Applications have come in and still require to
be called. Once Admin/Agent clicks on this circle which will be on all
the pages it will bring up the list of all Clients that need to be
called. Admin/Agent selects from the list and calls the selected Client
and once a Memo is entered into the Client profile the Client will no
longer be listed in the CALL BOX/Call List.

> Once the Client places an Application, the system will send them an
> email every day to Push them to take action. This can only be paused
> by Admin/Agent setting a Call Back or Reengagement time if a Client
> needs time to complete the next Step.

15\. Call Client List -- This list contains all Approved Clients that
have not been called, New Applications and General Clients that have not
been called. Within each Client Profile, there will be a Drop Down Date
Selector Agent/Admin will select when the Client will be called back and
will determine if the Client remains in the Call Client List. Paid
Clients are not on this list. Once the Client has called or is called
and a memo is added to the file and/or Agent selects call back date
Client will remain Off the List until it is time to call them Back. The
Agent can also select the option not to call back the Client.

16\. Admin has the ability to allow ALL to see Paid Clients. All = Agent
and Customer Service. Admin can allow only Customer Service to see Paid
Client when this is selected Customer Service/Agent can see the Client
in the list but will not have access to the file, such Clients will be
colored-coded. The Agent will only see minimal data on the Client, like\
Name/Address/City/State etc. Customer service will have full access to
this information.

> Only the Admin can edit the Client Profile unless the Admin gives
> permission to the Agent/Customer Service.

17\. Once the System issues Pre-Approval (after 2hrs to 1 day set by
Admin) of application submission). A Call Client Request is issued by
the System to Alert Agent to contact the Client and go over Approval.
Inside the Client's Profile, there will be a check box which the Agent
can check if they have spoken to the Client. When the Agent speaks to
the Client they will check the Client Box and input the memo in the Memo
Section. If the Agent did not reach the Client they will only input the
memo and the Client will remain on the List of Clients to Contact FIRST.
This Approval Call Back List is different from the General Call Back
List. This list will hold priority above the other list. After 3
attempts to contact the Client system will mark the task completed. The
Client will then be removed from this list. Also after 5 business days,
the Client will be removed from this List. Admin can also edit the
number of days or call attempts before being removed from this list.

18\. Payment feature will allow Admin to set up Fees based on the loan
amount.

> \- 1st fees structure will be a percentage of the loan amount and a
> one-off payment with an additional payment optional by the admin.
>
> \- 2nd fee will be the Subscription method and will be based on
> verifying loan amounts.
>
> Charge user based on loan amount, under \$5,000 monthly subscription
> of \$30, under \$10,000 \$50,
>
> under \$15,000 \$70, under 25,000 \$125, under 50,000 \$150, under
> \$100,000 \$200, under \$125,000

\$230\
19. The first action of Step 2 is to issue the Approval Email which
contains a link that when clicked will lead the client to log into the
Client Area where they are shown the Approval Document and then must
accept or cancel the Approval. If the Client accepts they will be shown
the next Steps to take in order to complete the process. If the Client
'cancels' they will be asked to confirm their decision and if confirmed
their account is closed. If the account is closed there should be a link
to allow the Client to re-open their file again. The process to reopen
the file is to send a request to Admin with the reason. Admin can either
re-open the File or Refuse, if it is refused then the option to re-open
fill will no longer show in Client Area.

> Only Admin can then re-open the file. This Approval Doc is created by
> Admin/AI and the System will auto-populate the receiver information.
>
> When the **APPROVAL.DOC** is created by the System and posted to the
> Client login area, there will be an alert that says "[You Have Been
> Approved]{.underline}". When the Client clicks the link they will be
> taken to the Approval Document which they can only view. Here they
> will have the option to ACCEPT approval and its conditions or Cancel.
>
> Admin can set how long it takes for the System to issue Approvals and
> can make changes on the fly for this period - from application to
> Approval issuance.
>
> **- No** Approval document can be dated on a [Sunday]{.underline} or a
> [Holiday]{.underline} of that country **- No** Email can be sent by
> System on a [Sunday]{.underline} or [Holiday]{.underline}.
>
> **-** System Emails can only be sent out during specific times set by
> Admin

20\. Create a **Holiday Folder**, Here AI will input the current year\'s
holidays for each country. The system should be able to understand how
to apply Canadian Holidays only to Canadian Clients, USA holidays to USA
Clients, and so on.

*21.* Ability to export and import new clients. When importing new
clients, only the Name, Email, fields are mandatory *(Amount, Address,
DOB, loanType, phone, SIN etc. are not mandatory).*

> Imported Clients that only have mandatory fields on file will be left
> in a folder called the 'Uncompleted' application. These clients will
> be sent an email by the System to proceed to complete the submission
> of their application. Within the email will be a link that will take
> them to the site's AI-Generated Landing Page showing the Loan
> Application with their data we have automatically populated into the
> form, the client will not be able to change these fields. *Add a memo
> section on the form, giving the client the option to request a change
> to the email or spelling of their name. This form will be separate
> from the normal site application form.*

22\. There is an Agreement that clients can view when logged in after
they have completed the first 2 Steps. This agreement should be editable
by Admin. The agreement is auto-populated with client information
including their loan information. The Client will digitally sign this
agreement. The print option is controlled by Admin, who can add or
remove this feature.

*23.* Client Area: this area will alert the client to what they need to
do next in order to proceed with their funding request. Clients will be
able to do the following while logged in:

> *1. View all steps, once a Step is completed they then gain access to
> the next step*\
> *2. Profile link shows their Loan Application, here they can request
> Admin to edit their Profile but they cannot make any edits, old data
> is always saved by the system, in memos*\
> *3. Upload files link, allows document uploading in different formats
> i.e. doc, docx, pdf, png, jpg, and other image files For Step 1*\
> *4. View the loan agreement and digitally sign it online, Step 2*\
> *5. Inbox to view all sent and received emails, this will be the main
> source of communication (full details of Email will appear in Clients
> System Inbox exactly as it was emailed to them) 6. Delay link, allows
> the client to delay their loan until they are able to cover fees,
> 21-day limit 7. Post Bank details to receive funding, shown only after
> Step 3, and complete the online PAD (Pre-Authorized Debit Form).*
>
> *8. View the loan repayment schedule, the system will create an
> amortization schedule based on the loan.*
>
> *9. Guarantee Link: This is a Pop-up document that will appear once
> the client clicks it. This form is only visible after the Client has
> been approved.*
>
> *10. When a client logs in they will always see some form of alert to
> push them through the system until all steps are completed.
> Pre-Approval, Complete Step 1, Complete Step 2, Complete Step 3,
> PROCESSING, LOAN APPROVED, Cancelled.*
>
> Clients\' main area is to be animated with these ALERTS.
>
> Clients will be able to see Agreement Link, PAD Link, Bank Form Link,
> Payment Form Link etc. however, they will not be able to click on
> these links until certain Steps have been completed. Payment link will
> not appear until Step 3 has been completed.
>
> After Step 3 is completed, clients will be directed to the online Bank
> Form details. This form is a little different from country to country.
> The Client inputs their bank information into the bank form.

24\. When the Admin/Agent changes the Client\'s Loan amount the system
should automatically edit the monthly payments, Fees, etc. These edits
will also be reflected on ALL document when displayed on Screen.

25\. After submission of the application System automatically sends out
a confirmation Email.

> Then an Alert *(email sent)* goes out to the client of Pre-Approval
> after 6hrs (this duration is editable by Admin) and requests that they
> complete Steps 1 to 3. Once these Steps are completed, they are [Given
> Full Approval]{.underline}. Pre-Approval and Full Approval is shown as
> an Alert when the Client Logs into their Account

26\. Service Fee Rates, the admin sets the Fee based on a percentage of
the loan amount. For example

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| > 1st Fees Structure              | > 2nd Fee Structure               |
+===================================+===================================+

| > additional payment if engaged   | >                                 |
| > by Admin.                       | > under \$5,000 monthly           |
| >                                 | > subscription of \$30, under     |
| > 5,000 to 10,000 it is 10.55%    | > \$10,000 monthly subscription   |
| > 10,001 to 20,000 its 9.80%      | > of \$50, under \$15,000 monthly |
| > 20,001 to 40,000 its 9.55%      | > subscription of \$70, under     |

| > 120,001 to 140,000 its 7.55%    | > of \$200, under \$125,000       |
| > 140,001 to up its 7.25%         | > monthly subscription of \$230   |
|                                   | > under \$150,000 monthly         |
|                                   | > subscription of \$250           |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

> These rates can be changed by Admin

27\. Interest Rates, admin sets these rates and can also edit them, for
example 9.75% Personal Loan\
8.5% Debt Consolidation\
8.25% Home Repairs\
8.25% Automotive Loans\
7.95% Business Loans\
9.75% Medical

28\. Loan Terms; admin sets these terms and can also edit them, for
example 5,000 to 10,000 it is 36mth\
10,001 to 18,000 it is 48mth\
18,001 to 30,000 its 60mth\
30,001 to 50,000 its 72mth\
50,001 to 80,000 its 84mth\
80,001 to 100,000 its 90mth\
100,001 to 160,000 its 96mth

29\. Email Blasting should be capable of sending to ALL Clients / Paid
Clients / Unpaid Clients / Cancelled Clients. AI AI-driven marketing
system that sends emails out based on settings within the system.

> 30\. Admin can set Reminder Notices to clients. These notices will be
> pre-formatted templates created by Admin. They can be set to be sent
> out to the client on a specific day, if such an email is set to go out
> then all other call-to-action emails will cease to go out until after
> that email has been sent. For example, if a client states that they
> need 2 weeks before they can complete Step 4 then the system will
> pause sending out emails until the Notice Email has been sent.
>
> 31\. AI Chatbot integrated into the Client Area as a question chat
> script? Here a client can ask questions and Bot will draw details from
> the preformatted emails setup by the Admin to communicate with Client.
> [Admin can Turn On/Off the Chatbot.]{.underline}
>
> 32\. Include a Remove from mailing list feature at the bottom of all

When the Client Logs in, they will see the "PreApproval" alert notice
after a certain time has passed after submitting their application. This
time is set by Admin and can be 10min or even 7 days.

Step 1: submit the Required Documents. Clients can log in and upload
files, they will have 3 different document types that they must upload
in order to complete this step.

1\) photo ID,\
2) proof of income\
3) proof of address as in utility bill *(this can be the same item as a
driver\'s license has the address on it).*

Once submitted Admin/Agent will be alerted so that they can confirm
receipt. Admin can set this to auto-accept after a certain time has
passed (6hrs to 48hrs). Agent/Admin will review documents and can then
mark the Step as completed.

Create a [Folder]{.underline} called **Document Review.** When client
submits their Documents in Step 1 they will be posted in a Folder called
Document Review. Admin/Agent will go into this folder to review
Documents and approve or disapprove. If approved the Client goes to the
Next Step and System then Pushes the Client to complete Step 2. If
disapproved, the client is sent an email saying that the accepted
documents and they are required to resend the documents. For example, if
they only submitted a

driver\'s license, then Admin can send out the email stating that they
need to submit Proof of Income and Utility Bill and so on. In this
section, Admin will have a selection of Pre-formatted Emails to send
out, which corresponds to the missing document(s). These Sets of
Pre-formatted Emails should be in their own Folder/Section. **Or system
can ask which documents are missing and send out the email based on the
missing documents.**

Upon submission and Approval of the required documents, the Client is
now **approved**.

Step 2: Final Approval is given and the client must digitally sign the
[Agreement Online]{.underline}. 12hrs after signing, Full Approval is
given and shown when logged in, this time period can be edited by Admin.

Step 3: Complete the Bank Form by providing bank account details of the
account to which funds

are to be sent.

Step 4: Bond Fee is requested, OPTIONS on how to send the Bond fee are
also given. After

sending, the client is to log back into the system to complete the Fee
Send FORM which will detail how and when the fee was sent. Admin will
confirm RECEIPT of fees and mark it completed.

> \- 36hrs later (set by Admin) system sends out a link to the online
> PAD form for the client to complete and digitally sign online.

\- 5 days later system sends out a link to the online Asset/Liability
form to complete and digitally sign\
Above emails will be listed in the folder "Edit Step 5 Templates", all
periods are editable by Admin.

Admin will be able to create emails and set them to go out after a
certain time after the fee is paid *(Edit Step 5 Templates)*.

Admin should be able to submit Applications on behalf of a client.

ADMIN must have the ability to set the time

when every Auto Email goes out.

Create a Client Document Folder. Here all documents will be created in
the system and displayed to User. The User will have the option to print
the document in PDF format. This option is given by the Admin if it is
not given User can only view the document online. All documents that
require a user\'s signature will be digitally signed online.

Only certain documents can be downloaded in PDF format by the Client if
ENABLED by Admin.
