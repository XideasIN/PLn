**Impact**: 
- ✅ Scripts now run without encoding errors
- ✅ Improved deployment compatibility
- ✅ Better file processing reliability

### 2. Script Functionality Enhancement
**Issue**: Empty or incomplete utility scripts
**Files Enhanced**:

#### `scripts/dependency_verification.py`
- **Added**: Comprehensive dependency verification system
- **Features**:
  - Python package dependency checking
  - Node.js dependency verification
  - Database connection testing
  - Environment variable validation
  - File structure verification
  - Detailed reporting with status indicators

#### `scripts/system_redundancy_scan.py`
- **Added**: Complete system redundancy analysis tool
- **Features**:
  - Duplicate file detection using SHA-256 hashing
  - Unused file identification
  - Redundant code pattern detection
  - Configuration redundancy analysis
  - Comprehensive reporting with recommendations

### 3. Configuration File Validation
**Issue**: Monitoring configuration needed validation
**Files Verified**:
