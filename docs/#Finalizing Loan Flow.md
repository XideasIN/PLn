Read through these documents, make sure Client Area, and Admin/User Area have access to all the features listed, fix any issues found, and make sure that all links/processes are functioning correctly.

The website base-template and index page should be laid out as follows:
- /Personal Loan/TEMPLATE_CONTROL_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
- /Personal Loan/doc/BASE_TEMPLATE_SYSTEM.md 
- /Personal Loan/doc/footer disclaimer.md
- /Personal Loan/doc/TEMPLATE_CONTROL_SYSTEM.md




FIX ALL ISSUES AND MAKE SURE THERE ARE NO FAILED TESTS:
‚Ä¢ Make sure Admin has access to features
‚Ä¢ Add tool help tips inside the Admin and Client areas
‚Ä¢ Add several onboard for the Admin area (creating email templates, etc.)
‚Ä¢ Make sure the Client area provides all needed features
‚Ä¢ Create an onboarding for the Client area on how to proceed through the loan process
‚Ä¢ Make sure the main Frontend 1pg site has all sections laid out inside the .md file
‚Ä¢ Make sure communication between Client and Admin/Users is working
‚Ä¢ Make sure Admin can create all templates and configure their setting accordingly

THE TEST NEEDS TO BE THOROUGH TO MAKE SURE ALL FEATURES ARE FULLY OPERATIONAL WITHOUT ERROR (100% PASS RATE)

Check if a self-marketing system is installed in this project.

=======================================

-	Have all files on LIVE server been updated?
-	The self-marketing system control should be within the Admin section (create onboarding to assist Admin on how to utilize it)
-	The outgoing email templates' footer must be of an Enterprise-level look, make sure of this
-	The Lead import feature must support .txt, .csv, .xlsx, etc., and allow Admin to select and match fields from the lead document with system fields.  Once leads are imported system will proceed to market to those leads using the email templates created by Admin.  
-	Create a sample email template for each category of email templates. This sample is set to never go out and is only displayed to Admin.  For Admin to delete the sample, it must be double authenticated.
-	The project should be using MySQL DB.  What is SQLAlchemy

The import features has already been implemented, check before you create new feature!

=======================================

The last test shows a 94.1% success rate, I need it to be a 100% success rate:
‚úÖ Passed: 64
‚ùå Failed: 4
üìä Total: 68
üéØ Success Rate: 94.1%

Check the backend and make sure all features there are accessible by the Admin/User or Client

Have you completed the thorough testing of the remaining areas to achieve 100% pass rate.

=======================================

Continue with thorough testing of these remaining areas to achieve a 100% pass rate. Why is it taking so long to complete the thorough testing?  Every time you test, you come back saying that you still have to test the same components. What are you doing if not testing?

-	Check if these dependencies have been installed
  python3 python3-pip python3-venv \
  nginx \
  nodejs npm \
  supervisor \
  redis-server \
  mysql-server
-	Has the backup system been fully installed?  If so, add it to the Admin area so that Admin can download backups, delete backups to save server space, etc.  Backups are to be automatically completed weekly.  Admin can randomly create a backup at any time.  Backup options should be Full System Backup or Project and DB backup.
-	Has the live server file been fully updated?
-	Need you to run the Test on the live server, that is where it counts.

After completing the above, continue with the thorough testing of all remaining areas.

=======================================

We are working on the /Personal Loan project do not bring any other project folders into this project.  Deal with /Personal Loan project ONLY!

Log in to the LIVE SERVER for /Personal Loan project and run the test there.  Provide me with a 100% success rate.

http://127.0.0.1:8090 is not the LIVE server, I need you to do testing on the LIVE SERVER and not the virtual server.  DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME!!!

=======================================

The server IP is 66.42.81.7, please update this as currently you have the server as 198.251.88.29!

Ok, the React template, which is inside this folder, was created from this image.  See if you can use the image to enhance the script and make the page visible. Do not create a new template, I want the exact same-looking template as shown in the image.  Create a pixel-perfect replica that matches every detail - fonts, images, layout, and styling exactly as shown.

WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO:
-	Create a React base-template by REPLICATING the image Ploan2.png
-	The illustrated images have been saved to the folder /images
-	Use those exact visual elements
-	Replicate the precise layout, exact fonts, colors, and spacing
-	Create a website that looks IDENTICAL to your image in every detail

Replicate EVERYTHING exactly as shown; do not create your own interpretations.  Create a truly exact replica using the actual visual elements from the image




Header:  the links inside the header should bring to the section which is on the page, services should take you to the services section of the page and so on.  

Our Services: the ‚ÄòApply now‚Äô link is supposed to be a button as shown in the image attached.
About: the words 'About Us' is above the image you have these words on the right and not above the image on the left.

How we works:  this section shows an image on the left and text on the right, then it shows an image on the right and text on the left. The image and text alternate from left to right to give it a more unique look, but you have all images on the left side for all points. Can‚Äôt you see this?  You should be able to see this, as you know how to read text.

About us: the words ‚ÄòAbout us‚Äô is over the image, which is on the left however, you have it over the text, which is on the right.

Footer: inside the footer, you have everything justified to the left however, the image shows it centered. Again, you need to match what‚Äôs inside the image I sent you.  Also, there is an image in the background can‚Äôt you find a similar image to be placed in background?
