It should be a set-it-and-leave type system, and the system will run itself, generate new customers, service these customers, and provide an AAA product, do you understand?  An autonomous system controller that gives Admin the ability to monitor and intervene when needed.  The dashboard should show tasks completed by AI on a daily basis so the Admin can have a live view of what is going on within the system at all times.  The system should run on its own with minimal human interaction.
